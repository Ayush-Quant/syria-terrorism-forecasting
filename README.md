# Syria-terrorism-forecasting
This project analyzes and forecasts monthly terrorism trends in Syria using historical GTD data. It compares classical statistical models (SARIMAX) with deep learning (LSTM) to understand escalation dynamics, regime shifts, and early-warning signals in high-risk environments.
This project presents an end-to-end data science pipeline for forecasting terrorism trends in Syria using monthly incident data from the Global Terrorism Database (1970–2017). The analysis explicitly models the structural break associated with the 2011 Syrian Civil War and compares the performance of a classical SARIMAX baseline with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The objective is not to predict individual attacks, but to understand temporal dynamics, escalation behavior, and model reliability under conflict-driven volatility. The project emphasizes reproducibility, interpretability, and responsible use of sensitive data.
